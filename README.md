I'm a design-minded front-end software engineer focused on building beautiful interfaces & experiences.
I am a software engineer based in Islamabad, Pakistan who enjoys building things that live on the internet. I develop exceptional websites and web apps that provide intuitive, pixel-perfect user interfaces with efficient and modern backends.


Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:

âœ¨  HTML                   âœ¨  CSS

âœ¨  JAVASCRIPT (ES6+)      âœ¨  Node.js

âœ¨  Git & Github           âœ¨  Chrome DevTools

âœ¨ Web Scraping            âœ¨  Figma


I love learning new and better ways to create seamless user experiences with clean, efficient, and scalable code. I consider work an ongoing education, and I'm always looking for opportunities to work with those who are willing to share their knowledge as much as I want to learn. At the end of the day, my primary goal is to create something beautiful with people that bring out the best in me.
